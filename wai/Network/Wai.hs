This module defines a generic web application interface. It is a common
protocol between web servers and web applications.

The overriding design principles here are performance and generality. To
address performance, this library is built on top of the conduit and
blaze-builder packages.  The advantages of conduits over lazy IO have been
debated elsewhere and so will not be addressed here.  However, helper functions
like 'responseLBS' allow you to continue using lazy IO if you so desire.

Generality is achieved by removing many variables commonly found in similar
projects that are not universal to all servers. The goal is that the 'Request'
object contains only data which is meaningful in all circumstances.

Please remember when using this package that, while your application may
compile without a hitch against many different servers, there are other
considerations to be taken when moving to a new backend. For example, if you
transfer from a CGI application to a FastCGI one, you might suddenly find you
have a memory leak. Conversely, a FastCGI application would be well served to
preload all templates from disk when first starting; this would kill the
performance of a CGI application.

This package purposely provides very little functionality. You can find various
middlewares, backends and utilities on Hackage. Some of the most commonly used
include:

[warp] <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/warp>

[wai-extra] <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai-extra>

[wai-test] <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai-test>

-- | Creating 'Response' from 'Builder'.
--
-- Some questions and answers about the usage of 'Builder' here:
--
-- Q1. Shouldn't it be at the user's discretion to use Builders internally and
-- then create a stream of ByteStrings?
--
-- A1. That would be less efficient, as we wouldn't get cheap concatenation
-- with the response headers.
--
-- Q2. Isn't it really inefficient to convert from ByteString to Builder, and
-- then right back to ByteString?
--
-- A2. No. If the ByteStrings are small, then they will be copied into a larger
-- buffer, which should be a performance gain overall (less system calls). If
-- they are already large, then blaze-builder uses an InsertByteString
-- instruction to avoid copying.
--
-- Q3. Doesn't this prevent us from creating comet-style servers, since data
-- will be cached?
--
-- A3. You can force blaze-builder to output a ByteString before it is an
-- optimal size by sending a flush command.

-- | Creating 'Response' from a stream of values.
--
-- In order to allocate resources in an exception-safe manner, you can use the
-- @bracket@ pattern outside of the call to @responseStream@. As a trivial
-- example:
--
-- @
-- app :: Application
-- app req respond = bracket_
--     (putStrLn \"Allocating scarce resource\")
--     (putStrLn \"Cleaning up\")
--     $ respond $ responseStream status200 [] $ \\write flush -> do
--         write $ byteString \"Hello\\n\"
--         flush
--         write $ byteString \"World\\n\"
-- @
--
-- Note that in some cases you can use @bracket@ from inside @responseStream@
-- as well. However, placing the call on the outside allows your status value
-- and response headers to depend on the scarce resource.
--
-- Since 3.0.0

-- | Middleware is a component that sits between the server and application. It

-- function to load up session information. The session information is simply a
-- string map \[(String, String)\]. A logical type signature for this middleware
-- might be:
--
-- @ loadSession :: ([(String, String)] -> Application) -> Application @

-- Here, instead of taking a standard 'Application' as its first argument, the
-- middleware takes a function which consumes the session information as well.
