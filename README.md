An interface between Haskell web frameworks and web servers.

A Haskell web application targets WAI and then can be deployed to any backend with a WAI adaptor.
The premier WAI backend is the Warp web server.

WAI also adds modularity and code-sharing through middleware and WAI applications.
Code can be written that works with any web framework targeting WAI.
