Warp is a high performance, easy to deploy HTTP server backend for
WAI \cref{wai}.  Since the last HCAR, Warp has followed WAI in its move from conduit to a lower level streaming data abstraction. We've additionally continued work on more optimizations, and improved support for power efficiency by using the auto-update package.

Due to the combined use of ByteStrings, blaze-builder, conduit, and GHC's improved I/O manager, WAI+Warp has consistently proven to be Haskell's most performant web deployment option.

Warp is actively used to serve up most of the users of WAI (and Yesod).
